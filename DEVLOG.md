# Development Log

A chronological record of development progress, decisions, and current work status.

## üìÖ July 13, 2025

### Initial Project Setup ‚úÖ

- **Git Repository Initialized**

  - Created local git repo with `main` branch
  - Added comprehensive `.gitignore` for Node.js/C++ project
  - Initial commit (b009ca2) with complete codebase
  - Repository ready for feature branch development

- **Documentation Created**
  - Comprehensive README.md with project overview, API docs, examples
  - Claude context file (`.claude-context.md`) for AI assistant continuity
  - Development log (this file) for tracking progress

### Current Codebase Status ‚úÖ

- **Core Features Working:**

  - PipeWire session management
  - Audio output streams with multiple formats (Float32/64, Int16/32, UInt16/32)
  - TypeScript API with async/await and generator patterns
  - Resource management with Symbol.asyncDispose
  - Event system for stream state/property changes
  - Working examples: tone generation, white noise

- **Build System:**
  - node-gyp configuration for C++ native addon
  - TypeScript compilation to ESM modules
  - Build scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run build:native:debug`

### Next Development Priorities üéØ

**Immediate Goals:**

1. **Audio Input Streams** - Implement capture functionality
2. **Stream Node Targeting** - Connect streams to specific PipeWire nodes
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Better error reporting and recovery

**Future Goals:**

1. Performance optimization (zero-copy buffers)
2. Extended format support (24-bit, multi-channel)
3. Testing framework and CI/CD
4. Advanced examples (synthesizers, effects processors)

### Development Environment

- **OS:** Linux with PipeWire
- **Node.js:** 22+ (ESM required)
- **Editor:** VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- **AI Assistant:** Claude Sonnet 4
- **Terminal:** VS Code configured to use bash for consistency (personal shell choice doesn't affect project)

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Architecture:** Native C++ core with TypeScript wrapper
- **Module System:** ESM modules throughout
- **Resource Management:** Symbol.asyncDispose for automatic cleanup
- **Audio Processing:** Generator functions for sample streaming
- **Error Handling:** Exceptions in C++, Promise rejection in JS
- **Build System:** node-gyp + TypeScript compiler
