## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Standards

This documentation is organized using the **DiÃ¡taxis framework** which separates content into four distinct types:

- **Tutorials** are _learning-oriented_ - they help you learn through practice
- **How-to guides** are _problem-oriented_ - they help you solve specific issues
- **Reference** is _information-oriented_ - it provides technical specifications
- **Explanation** is _understanding-oriented_ - it clarifies concepts and context

This structure ensures you get the right type of information for your current needs, whether you're learning, problem-solving, looking up details, or seeking deeper understanding.
